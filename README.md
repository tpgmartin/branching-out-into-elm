# Introduction

This book is as much my attempt to teach others how to learn Elm as my own effort to teach myself the language. With that in mind, I will be writing from my own perspective so the closer your profile matches mine, the more likely you are to benefit. A bit about myself then: I am a full stack web developer with around two years of experience as of this writing. In that time I have mostly dealt with full stack JavaScript for both the back-end and front-end, which means node plus some front-end framework. I am also very new to the functional programming paradigm, which I have only really discovered by working with Elm.

## Why Elm?

In the last year or so, the concept of functional programming has become increasingly popular for front-end web development. Why is this? The promise of functional programming is that it makes your life that much easier than the typical object-orientated approach. Problems writing, debugging and running your code in production are largely avoided. If you're unclear why this is, don't worry, so was I (and still am to a certain extent!). We will explore basic concepts of functional programming that reveal why this is the case.

But why *Elm*? You could quite rightly argue that sticking to a JavaScript library that follows more functional language principles, such as Redux, would be better to explore this programming paradigm. To a certain extent, I agree. The problem is that it's *still* JavaScript, which means we are not enforced to stick to functional language principles at the compiler-level but rather just by convention. If we want immutability we need to import another library, if we want types we need to cross-compile to JavaScript, and so on. With Elm, we get all of this out of the box. 

## How this Book is Structured

This book can be read it two ways, either in order or by topic. The book does not assume any familiarity with either Elm or functional programming, but does assume the reader is reasonably comfortable with the JavaScript language and related topics (see above). 

The beauty of Elm, is that it is very beginner friendly, you are only exposed to as much of the inner workings as you need. And I will follow this cue. Key functional programming will be introduced as and when you need them.
